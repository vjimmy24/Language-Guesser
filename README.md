# Language-Guesser
Quick language guesser using NPM packages "franc", "lang", and "colors".
Requires use of node and the command line.
To use, pass through node index.js 'phrase you want to pass through', and the shell will print the language the phrase is in.
If you enter an invalid phrase (incoherent or too short), the shell will return an error message.
